# DIGITAL COMMUNICATION LABS

This repository contains various laboratory exercises on digital communication. The aim is to deepen my understanding of core concepts in the course. Learning by doing has always been my preferred method.

## Laboratory Exercises

- [Lab 1 - Analysis of Sampling Theorem Using MATLAB](https://github.com/plochoidysis-ojwege/Digital-communication-Labs/tree/main/1.%20Lab%201%20-%20Analysis%20of%20Sampling%20Theorem%20Using%20MATLAB)
- [Lab 2 - Design and Implementation of Lossless Compression for Bernoulli Sequences and Erd˝os-Renyi Graphs](https://github.com/plochoidysis-ojwege/Digital-communication-Labs/tree/main/2.%20Lab%202-ER-graph-huffman)
- [Lab 3 - ](will be updated soon)

### About the Labs
These labs cover fundamental digital communication principles. Each lab focuses on a specific concept, with code and explanations to demonstrate the theory in practice.
Stay tuned for more updates.
