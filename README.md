# DIGITAL COMMUNICATION LABS

This repository contains various laboratory exercises on digital communication. The aim is to deepen my understanding of core concepts in the course. Learning by doing has always been my preferred method.

## Laboratory Exercises

- [Lab 1 - Analysis of Sampling Theorem Using MATLAB](https://github.com/plochoidysis-ojwege/Digital-communication-Labs/tree/main/1.%20Lab%201%20-%20Analysis%20of%20Sampling%20Theorem%20Using%20MATLAB)
- [Spectrum analysis and Wide Sense Stationarity (WSS)](https://github.com/plochoidysis-ojwege/Digital-communication-Labs/tree/main/Spectrum%20and%20simulation)
- [Lab 2 ](will be updated soon)

### About the Labs
These labs are designed to provide practical experience with fundamental digital communication principles. Each lab focuses on a specific concept, with code and explanations to demonstrate the theory in practice.
Stay tuned for more updates.
